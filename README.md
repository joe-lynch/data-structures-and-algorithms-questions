# data structure and algorithm questions
Worked solutions to various leetcode questions that I find interesting.

Each question is treated as a standalone class, except for the LinkedList questions that all use the class ListNode.
Each file has a single class, with a main function that creates the object of that class, and calls methods to solve the problem.
The keyword `assert` is used, this will throw an error if the solution returned isn't as expected. But it will only do so when the code is compiled with the `-enableassertions` or `-ea` flag.
